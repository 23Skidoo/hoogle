Before alpha:

* Give a reasonable semantics for package:foo set:stackage
* Make set:stackage be the default, and have no effect (not "")
* Change restrict= parsing to use the normal parser

After alpha:

* Add a log view, number of errors, average response time etc
* Add a replay mode to replay web interactions and benchmark
* Add is:package is:module
* Add easy to restrict/include package: things on the LHS
* Implement type search
* Write a better updating script, with redownloading, zero-downtime and testing
