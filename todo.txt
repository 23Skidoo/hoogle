Before alpha:

* Remove duplicates from the output, between packages and modules
* Give a reasonable semantics for package:foo set:stackage
* Make set:stackage be the default, and have no effect (not "")
* Change restrict= parsing to use the normal parser

After alpha:

* Add easy to restrict/include package: things on the LHS
* Implement type search
* Write a better updating script, with redownloading
